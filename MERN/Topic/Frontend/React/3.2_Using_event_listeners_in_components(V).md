# Using Event Listeners in React components

Events are those activities which let's a component to behave in a certain manner.

Event listeners basically looks out for these events.

Event Handlers handles these events.

For e.g. If you want to display a popup on clicking a button then **"clicking"** is an event which is looked out for by the event listener and **"displaying"** of popup is handled by event handler.
