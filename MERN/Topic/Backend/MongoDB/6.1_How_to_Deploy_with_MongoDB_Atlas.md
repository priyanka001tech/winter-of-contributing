<h1 align="center">How to Deploy with MongoDB Atlas</h1>


## What is MongoDB Atlas ?
MongoDB Atlas is a cloud service by MongoDB. It is built for developers who'd rather spend time building apps than managing databases. This service is available on AWS, Azure, and GCP.

It is the worldwide cloud database service for modern applications that give best-in-class automation and proven practices guarantee availability, scalability, and compliance with the foremost demanding data security and privacy standards. We can use MongoDB's robust ecosystem of drivers, integrations, and tools to create faster and spend less time managing our database.


<p>&nbsp</p>

### Advantages of MongoDB Atlas

- **Global clusters for world-class applications:** Using MongoDB Atlas, we are free to choose the cloud partner and ecosystem that fit our business strategy.

- **Secure for sensitive data:** It offers built-in security controls for all our data. It enables enterprise-grade features to integrate with our existing security protocols and compliance standard.

- **Designed for developer productivity:** MongoDB Atlas moves faster with general tools to work with our data and a platform of services that makes it easy to build, secure, and extend applications that run on MongoDB.

- **Reliable for mission-critical workload:** It is built with distributed fault tolerance and automated data recovery.

- **Built for optimal performance:** It makes it easy to scale our databases in any direction. We can get more out of our existing resources with performance optimization tools and real-time visibility into database metrics.

- **Managed for operational efficiency:** It comes with built-in operational best practices, so we can focus on delivering business value and accelerating application development instead of managing databases.

<p>&nbsp</p>


- Select your preferred Cloud Provider & Region. It supports M0 Free Tier clusters on Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure. The regions that support M0 Free tier clusters are marked with the "**Free Tier Available**" label.

<p>&nbsp</p>

![mongoDb-link](https://static.javatpoint.com/mongodb/images/mongodb-atlas4.png)

<p>&nbsp</p>


- Select **M0 Sandbox** for cluster tier: Selecting M0 automatically locks the remaining configuration options. If you can't select the M0 cluster tier, return to the previous step and choose a Cloud Provider & Region that supports M0 Free Tier clusters.

<p>&nbsp</p>

![mongoDb-link](https://static.javatpoint.com/mongodb/images/mongodb-atlas5.png)

<p>&nbsp</p>


- Enter a name for your cluster in the Cluster Name field; you can enter any name for your cluster. The cluster name contains ASCII letters, numbers, and hyphens.

<p>&nbsp</p>

![mongoDb-link](https://static.javatpoint.com/mongodb/images/mongodb-atlas6.png)

<p>&nbsp</p>


- Click on Create Cluster to deploy the cluster. Once you deploy your cluster, it can take up to 5-10 min for your cluster to provision and become ready to use.

<p>&nbsp</p>

![mongoDb-link](https://static.javatpoint.com/mongodb/images/mongodb-atlas7.png)

<p>&nbsp</p>


- Once we register, Atlas automatically creates a default organization and project where we can deploy our first cluster. We can add additional organizations and projects later.

## Connecting nodejs application to MongoDB Atlas.

<p>&nbsp</p>

![mongoDB](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/de2a1f1fece8406b44b9b49b8f9a50648e38ec22086226b8c95978dc95cd6dfd/68747470733a2f2f63646e2e6472696262626c652e636f6d2f75736572732f3737363836372f73637265656e73686f74732f363137393634342f6d6f6e676f676f6f6f2e676966)

<p>&nbsp</p>

- **Step 1: Register/Login and create your plan**

Create an account with Atlas and sign up for their services. It's completely free. Proceed if you already have an account. If this is your first time signing in, you will be prompted to select a plan for your account. There are three varieties to select from; for testing and learning purposes, the "FREE PLAN" is ideal. It's time to build a Cluster after you've completed all of the basic registration and setup.


<p>&nbsp</p>


- **Step 2: Create your Cluster**

After Registration/Login and choosing your plan, let's get our Cluster setup done.

If you have no created clusters, you will see the below page on your dashboard.

<p>&nbsp</p>

![MongoDB-dashboard](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--M4wsAhjo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/okaa9x6n5zkbiqbyjsh8.PNG)

<p>&nbsp</p>

Upon clicking "Build a cluster", you will be given with the following options:


<p>&nbsp</p>


![next-options](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9wGxkEdV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/lo40h9xdfa34yvdgfw9o.PNG)


<p>&nbsp</p>

On this screen, you must choose your Cloud Provider and Region. After you've chosen those, you may leave the rest of the settings alone and continue. If you wish to alter your Cluster's name, you must do it solely at this stage. The cluster's name cannot be altered once it has been established.

To build a Cluster, you must complete all of the procedures listed above. MongoDB will now setup and create your cluster, which should take 5-10 minutes (pretty long tbh). Return to the same page once you've completed everything.

Now we'll look at how to create and setup database collections, as well as how to connect them to our express server.


<p>&nbsp</p>


- **Step 3: Add User and whitelist IP address**

Till this step, we have successfully created our Cluster. Now, its time to add Database User and IP address of your current machine.

    1. Add database user Go to Database access under SECURITY and click on "Add New Database User". Fill out the username and password, leaving all settings to default and make sure you remember your credentials. We will need it later on to create a connection string (URI) of our DB.


![establishing-connection](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ifkyepuR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/zeswtumav6ol4r1gj3e0.PNG)
    
    
    2. Whitelist your IP address Now, the next step is to Whitelist your IP address so it can recognize your machine for regular access. To whitelist your IP address, go to SECURITY > Network Access and click on "Add IP Address". Upon clicking that, you will be given with the following page. Click on Allow access from anywhere which sets it to global access. Don't worry, its not any danger.


![setting-up](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0mq_MH03--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/4a6h5i08x76ibxpymk0d.PNG)


Now, we've all set up done to use it to our Node.js server. It's time for some code.


<p>&nbsp</p>


- **Step 4: Connect to your database**
In this step, we will connect our server to the database. To do this, go to the main page of your cluster and click on "Connect" which will give you a modal like this:

<p>&nbsp</p>

![connect-to-database](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9AGhn-P3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/04x3qer1fq1qm60xwriz.PNG)

<p>&nbsp</p>

Select "Connect your application". On clicking, you have to select "Node.js" in the next page and save the connection string provided by Atlas somewhere for further use.

<p>&nbsp</p>

![application-connection](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sV3d1iFz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/d2zjt76o932j9pr8fctb.PNG)

<p>&nbsp</p>

Now, its time to create our database connection using mongoose. Install mongoose in your project by npm install mongoose. Copy-paste the following code to db.js.


```js
//db.js

const mongoose = require('mongoose')

const url = `mongodb+srv://sample_user:<password>@my-sample-cluster-b3ugy.mongodb.net/<dbname>?retryWrites=true&w=majority`;

const connectionParams={
    useNewUrlParser: true,
    useCreateIndex: true,
    useUnifiedTopology: true 
}
mongoose.connect(url,connectionParams)
    .then( () => {
        console.log('Connected to database ')
    })
    .catch( (err) => {
        console.error(`Error connecting to the database. \n${err}`);
    })
```

Replace "password" with your user password and also the "dbname" with the name you'd like to have for your database. Run the following code by typing node db.js and you will see Connected to the database in your console. You can take this to the next step by configuring your DB model by creating a "Collection" with various fields and connecting it with the express server. I leave it up to you to use according to your need. This was the basic setup needed to get Atlas up and running.
