# Simple calculator using node and express.

## Steps for using express and node in a project :

- `npm init` which will set up a new or existing npm package ,although its not necessary step but a package.json file will be generated and placed in the current directory for us to check the dependencies and their versions and other information related to the project.
- `npm install express` ,this will install and set up express in our project,providing us with simple APIs for creating endpoints.
- For running the code we write in the terminal,`node {filename}` eg-`node index.js`.

## Coding part

- we firstly require express in our project by writing this,it would load express modules and gives us access to its exports
```
const express = require('express');

```
- We set up middleware for our application, by calling the express function "express()" thereby putting a  new Express application inside the app variable (to start a new Express application).

```
const app = express();
```

- We write express.json(),which is a method inbuilt in express to recognize the incoming Request Object as a JSON Object. This method is called as a middleware in our application by this code:

```
app.use(express.json());
```

## - Now we start building our calculator:

1.We write a get request here, requesting to provide us with 2 numbers for addition,subtraction or any other operation, which is a common HTTP request used for building REST API.It has 2 parameters,`path`,to which it is called,eg- **/add** and second,the `callback` function which usually has 2 parameters,a req and a res.

**The express.js request object represents the HTTP request and has properties for the request query string, parameters, body, HTTP headers, and so on.**

**The Response object (res) specifies the HTTP response which is sent by an Express app when it gets an HTTP request.It sends response back to the client browser.**

```
app.get('/add',(req,res)=>{
res.send(`Please enter 2 numbers for addition`);
});
```

- Lets look at what we get in postman.

2.We write a post request for giving in 2 numbers as raw data in the json format in postman and getting the output as a json object for the same.Express doesn't parse HTTP request bodies by default, but it does have a built-in middleware that populates the req.body property with the parsed request body. For example, app.use(express.json()) is how we tell Express to automatically parse JSON request bodies.
**Post request also has 2 parameters,a path and a callback just like get request.**


Here, `num1` and `num2` will be the numbers we will be getting from the `req.body` which we will provide to postman as a raw data in json format.The req.body property contains key-value pairs of data submitted in the request body. By default, it is undefined and gets populated when we use middlewares such as express.json() i.e,

The json() middleware adds a body property to the Express request req .To access the parsed request body, use req.


`res.send` is a function that accepts a single parameter body that describe the body which is to be sent in the response which include  a String or an object or an Array,here,we get the result of operations for the same.

```

app.post('/add',(req,res)=>{
    let num1=req.body.n1;
    let num2=req.body.n2;
    let sum=num1+num2;
    res.send({addition: sum});
    });

```

- Lets look at what we get in postman.

- We do the same for the rest.

### 2.Subtraction:

```
 app.get('/subtract',(req,res)=>{
        res.send(`Please enter 2 numbers for subtraction`);
        });
        
      
```

<img width="664" alt="postman2a" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74200798/136608226-9668d4cf-1e68-4278-a4ae-a7c9c3e37827.png">


```
  
        app.post('/subtract',(req,res)=>{
            let num1=req.body.n1;
            let num2=req.body.n2;
            let subtraction=num1-num2;
            res.send({subtraction: subtraction});
            });
```

### 3.Multiplication:

```
app.get('/multiply',(req,res)=>{
    res.send(`Please enter 2 numbers for multiplication`);
    });
      
```

<img width="665" alt="postman3a" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74200798/136608509-95d21270-5d62-4c21-a0c0-be05062e8209.png">


```
  
         app.post('/multiply',(req,res)=>{
        let num1=req.body.n1;
        let num2=req.body.n2;
        let multiplication=num1*num2;
        res.send({multiplication: multiplication});
        });
```

### 4.Division:

```
app.get('/divide',(req,res)=>{
    res.send(`Please enter 2 numbers for division`);
    });
        
      
```

<img width="665" alt="postman4a" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74200798/136608695-bfb48eb5-733c-43c1-8907-65d23ba2b12c.png">



```
  
        
    app.post('/divide',(req,res)=>{
        let num1=req.body.n1;
        let num2=req.body.n2;
        let division=num1/num2;
        res.send({division:division});
        });
    
```

<img width="664" alt="postman4b" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74200798/136608751-fd1efeb6-d2da-4a6f-ae76-2e6af14f82ab.png">


- Lastly we would be needing a listener which is a  function used to bind and listen the connections on the specified host and port.We write it like this,here we are using 3000 as the port address:

```
app.listen(3000);
```

Complete code would look something like this:

```
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());



//addition
app.get('/add',(req,res)=>{
res.send(`Please enter 2 numbers for addition`);
});


app.post('/add',(req,res)=>{
    let num1=req.body.n1;
    let num2=req.body.n2;
    let sum=num1+num2;
    res.send({addition: sum});
    });


//subtraction
    app.get('/subtract',(req,res)=>{
        res.send(`Please enter 2 numbers for subtraction`);
        });
        
        
        app.post('/subtract',(req,res)=>{
            let num1=req.body.n1;
            let num2=req.body.n2;
            let subtraction=num1-num2;
            res.send({subtraction: subtraction});
            });

 
            
//multiplication
app.get('/multiply',(req,res)=>{
    res.send(`Please enter 2 numbers for multiplication`);
    });
    
    
    app.post('/multiply',(req,res)=>{
        let num1=req.body.n1;
        let num2=req.body.n2;
        let multiplication=num1*num2;
        res.send({multiplication: multiplication});
        });

      
        
//division
app.get('/divide',(req,res)=>{
    res.send(`Please enter 2 numbers for division`);
    });
    
    
    app.post('/divide',(req,res)=>{
        let num1=req.body.n1;
        let num2=req.body.n2;
        let division=num1/num2;
        res.send({division:division});
        });
    


app.listen(3000);
```
