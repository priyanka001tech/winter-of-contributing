## Dynamic website

Dynamic websites are those websites that changes the content or layout with every request to the webserver. These websites have the capability of producing different content for different visitors from the same source code file. There are two kinds of dynamic web pages i.e. client side scripting and server side scripting. The client-side web pages changes according to your activity on the web page. On the server-side, web pages are changed whenever a web page is loaded.

Example: login & signup pages, application & submission forms, inquiry and shopping cart pages.

There are different languages used to create dynamic web pages like PHP, ASP, .NET and JSP. Whenever a dynamic page loads in browser, it requests the database to give information depending upon user’s input. On receiving information from the database, the resulting web page is applied to the user after applying the styling codes.

**Features of dynamic webpage :**

- These websites are very flexible.
- In these websites the content can be quickly changed on the user’s computer without new page request to the web browser.
- In these websites the owner have the ability to simply update and add new content to the site.
- These websites are featured with content management system, e-commerce system and intranet or extranet facilities.
- Most of the dynamic web content, is assembled on the web using server-scripting languages.

**Advantages of dynamic webpage :**

- It provides more functional websites.
- It is very easy to update.
- It helps in the search engines because new content brings people back to the site.
- These are interactive websites because these can be customized.
- These websites can work as a system to allow staff or users o collaborate.

**Disadvantages of dynamic webpages :**

- These types of websites are complex.
- These are more expensive to develop.
- Hosting of these websites is also costlier.
- It requires a rapid, high-end web server.

## Template engines

A template engine enables you to use static template files in your application. At runtime, the template engine replaces variables in a template file with actual values, and transforms the template into an HTML file sent to the client. This approach makes it easier to design an HTML page.

Some popular template engines that work with Express are Pug, Mustache, and EJS.

- **Pug**

    Pug is a templating engine for Express. Templating engines are used to remove the cluttering of our server code with HTML, concatenating strings wildly to existing HTML         templates. Pug is a very powerful templating engine which has a variety of features including filters, includes, inheritance, interpolation, etc.

- **HandleBars(hbs), Mustache**

    **Mustache** is described as a "logic-less" system because it lacks any explicit control flow statements, like if and else conditionals or for loops; however, both               looping and conditional evaluation can be achieved using section tags processing lists and lambdas.

    It is named "Mustache" because of heavy use of braces, { }, that resemble a sideways moustache.

    Handlebars is an extension to the Mustache templating language.It provides the power necessary to let you build semantic templates effectively with no frustration.


    **Handlebars** is largely compatible with Mustache templates. In most cases it is possible to swap out Mustache with Handlebars and continue using your current templates.

    Mustache is missing helpers and the more advanced blocks because it strives to be logicless. Handlebars' custom helpers can be very useful, but often end up introducing         logic into your templates.

- **EJS**

    EJS is a simple templating language that lets you generate **HTML markup with plain JavaScript**. No religiousness about how to organize things. No reinvention of iteration     and control-flow. It's just plain JavaScript.

## Rendering template files

To render template files, set the following application setting properties, in app.js in the default app created by the generator:

- **views**
It sets the directory where the template files are located. 
Eg:
```
app.set('views', './views')
```

This defaults to the views directory in the application root directory.

- **view engine**
It tells which template engine is used.
For example, to use the Pug template engine:
```
app.set('view engine', 'pug')
```

## res.render() vs res.send()

- **res.send()**

    It can be called only once and it sends data in chunk of some buffer size to client and then again comes back and sends another chunk of buffer size so there is a lot of back and forth http communication.

- **res.render()**

    It renders a view to the client.Optional parameters:

    - locals, an object whose properties define local variables for the view.

    - callback, a callback function. If provided, the method returns both the possible error and rendered string, but does not perform an automated response. When an error occurs, the method invokes next(err) internally.
